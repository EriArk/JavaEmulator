# AbyssME Changelog

User-facing development history, reconstructed from commits, release notes and
local/private build records through **2026-10-11**. This is not a claim that all
listed work is in a public APK. See [current status](docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) for
availability, verification, known limits and screenshot guidance.

Labels: **Public source** means implemented on `main` but unreleased unless
stated otherwise. **Experimental** means local/private combined builds only.
**Released** means an actual GitHub release asset.

## 2026-10-11

- **Separate experiment / not shipped:** expanded alternative M3G checks to
  scene loading and animation, with a separate unchanged-current-engine APK.
  Fixed premature multi-section loading in the candidate's generated sources.
  Candidate: 18/18 synthetic checks on Retroid and emulator; current engine:
  10/10 shared cases on Retroid, emulator attempts stalled/exited and remain
  unresolved. Published 17 frame comparisons and before/after reports, not
  game-compatibility claims or release APKs. Main engine/licensing unchanged.
  [Dated evidence](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/blob/9e758abe/docs/m3g-scenes-2026-10-11/README.md).
- **Separate experiment / not shipped:** built a standalone Android probe for
  a FreeJ2ME-Plus M3G alternative on `codex/m3g-replacement`. Eight synthetic
  checks passed on Retroid Pocket Classic and an x86_64 emulator; diagnostic
  screenshots and raw reports are published on that branch. Current mainline
  M3G and licensing remain unchanged; no real-game compatibility or replacement
  is claimed. [Branch results](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/blob/8d7aafdf/docs/M3G_REPLACEMENT.md).
- **Research / not shipped:** audited EKA2L1 as an embedded Symbian / N-Gage
  engine and documented one-app setup, import, controls and backup goals,
  source findings, licensing/build gates and staged acceptance. No native
  integration, game run or new APK in this batch.
  [Integration plan](docs/SYMBIAN_INTEGRATION.md).
- **Public source / experimental.15:** J2ME Loader whole-library import can
  request access to a blocked nested folder and resume scanning. Wrong-folder
  selection and cancellation are recoverable; save folders are checked and
  the access message remains readable. Source identity survives extra grants.
  [d39ed742](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/d39ed742),
  [workflow](docs/LIBRARY_TRANSFER.md).
- **Verification:** the combined Phone/Handheld APKs reported 132 selected
  Android cases OK per variant, subject to variant skips; 14 JVM tests per
  variant. A real J2ME Loader emulator import preserved the two RMS files by
  hash. This does not certify every provider or the reporter's devices.
- **Documentation/media:** published 12 fresh development screenshots covering
  the library, gameplay, mapping, touch layouts and settings, with an unchanged
  PNG pack and capture manifest.
  [2835c239](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/2835c239),
  [screenshots](screenshots/post-2026-10-11/README.md).
- **Documentation:** added the shared current-status source for website and
  post authors, including local-only work and evidence boundaries; added this
  historical changelog and an update contract. No new app build in this batch.

## 2026-10-10

- **Public source / experimental.13:** compact installer with scrollable
  details/archive choices, reachable actions and persistent errors. ZIPs
  selected through file pickers are recognized as archives.
  [696da084](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/696da084).
- **Public source / experimental.14:** accepting mismatched JAD/JAR metadata
  retains the selected source and reinstall identity instead of failing with
  a null URI. Different aliases for the same Downloads file remain a separate
  [open issue](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/issues/20).
  [7ba384b2](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/7ba384b2).
- **Integration status:** recorded the positive Wolphun response and requested
  precise permission scope. A later reply reaffirmed GPL 3.0; no combined
  public release was created. [Licensing record](docs/LICENSING.md).

## 2026-10-09

- **Public source / experimental.8:** unified library and in-game Display and
  Controls pages, with Try/Keep/Undo trials and automatic rollback of an
  unconfirmed preview. Expert settings remain separate.
  [5a4bc726](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/5a4bc726).
- **Public source / experimental.9:** compact console-style library and mapper
  pages for small handheld screens, more space for games, on-demand actions
  and controller navigation.
  [ba252272](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/ba252272).
- **Public source / experimental.10:** library focus fixes, conservative icon
  and cover selection, custom art and explicit legacy-art refresh.
  [17ef6dcf](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/17ef6dcf).
- **Public source / experimental.11:** compact Phone library and shared menus
  with reachable Back/Close actions while content scrolls.
  [1ae5503b](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/1ae5503b).
- **Public source / experimental.12:** Settings grouped into Library, Playing
  and Support; transfer chooser, selection and results separated for small
  screens. [83b2fc2d](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/83b2fc2d).

## 2026-10-08

- **Public source / experimental.5:** menu-based library backup/restore, screenshot actions,
  Phone orientation/contrast fixes and transfer documentation.
  [4f4d1468](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/4f4d1468).
- **Experimental.4:** an optional camera button for both engines, including
  non-pausing Mophun frame capture; app-wide visibility and PNG gallery storage.
- **Public source / experimental.6-7:** more conservative first-launch
  preparation. Explicit metadata wins; ambiguous hints, advertisements and
  unusual image dimensions do not force a guessed phone profile. Existing
  settings remain intact.
  [749ea2ed](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/749ea2ed),
  [230122df](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/230122df).
- **Verification:** a six-game archive sample recorded mixed results, including
  a recurring Ghost Recon black screen. These checks did not produce a broad
  compatibility guarantee. [Smoke matrix](docs/GAME_SMOKE_MATRIX.md).

## 2026-10-07

- **Public source:** graphical per-game controller mapper, named schemes and
  presets, button identification, D-pad/stick diagonal bindings, improved Phone
  numeric/Gamepad controls, live Java image rotation and display adjustments.
  J2ME Loader import and non-destructive migrations were included in this
  accumulated batch.
  [c49fef57](https://github.com/EriArk/JavaEmulator/commit/c49fef57).
- **Experimental, first combined snapshot:** Java and Mophun in the same
  Handheld app, `.mpn` import/library integration, shared mapper, targeted Deep
  Abyss 1.1/1.4 work, game-controlled save/resume, native dialog and scene API
  fixes, and MIDI for the verified 1.4 profile. Gameplay and selected scene
  transitions were observed; next-level completion was not confirmed.
- **Experimental.2:** supplied both Phone and Handheld APKs; live Java image
  rotation and improved touch/display experience. At this snapshot, Mophun
  still required physical controls.
- **Experimental.3:** Mophun gained the shared Phone keypad and virtual Gamepad
  in portrait and landscape, independent touch/physical input ownership and
  saved per-game touch settings.
- **Publication boundary:** Java/UI source was published while optional-engine
  implementation and game fixtures remained ignored locally. Existing licenses
  were retained; no public combined release was made.

## Earlier Milestones

- **2026-10-06, public source/docs:** contributor setup, support templates and
  public-repository cleanup; undocumented fixtures replaced. GitHub Actions
  remains intentionally disabled. New public APKs go to Releases, not the Git tree.
- **2026-10-04, media:** published the beta.2 screenshot set and source credits.
- **2026-07-20, released:** [beta.2](docs/releases/v0.1.0-beta.2.md) added a
  separately installable Phone variant with portrait/touch support while
  retaining the controller-first Handheld variant.
- **2026-07-18, released:** [beta.1](docs/releases/v0.1.0-beta.1.md), initial
  AbyssME beta release.
- **Before beta.1, public source:** retro-modern Gallery/List/Grid library,
  separated cover/icon presentation, enlarged icons, fullscreen game chrome,
  installer styling, quick display presets and early compatibility/artwork
  heuristics. These are baseline work, not newly announced October features.

## How to Add an Entry

Use the actual work/release date, a user-visible result, its availability label,
and a commit or evidence reference. Record limitations where they change the
claim. Test counts belong to the specific build and selected suites, not the
whole project. Do not erase earlier failures, invent release dates or rewrite
Git history to make a progress narrative look cleaner.
